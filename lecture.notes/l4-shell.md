6.828 2014 L4: Shell & OS organization
--

Homework solution
==

* Let's review solution for <a href="../homework/sh.c">sh.c</a>
  * exec
  * redirect
  * pipe

* The process graph for a complicated pipeline
  * Who waits for whom? (draw a tree of processes) 
  * Why close read-end and write-end? ensure that every process starts with 3
    file descriptors, and that reading from the pipe returns end of file after
    the first command exits.

Exploring system calls with more shell features
==

* You can run the shell, redirect its stdin/stdout, etc.
  * I'll run this shell script with ```sh < script```:
	```
     echo one
     echo two
	 ```
 * What will this shell command do?
    ``` $ sh < script > out ```
	
	* the script itself didn't redirect the echo output, but it did inherit a fd
   1 that was redirected to out.

    * to make this work it is important that offset is implicit (maintained by
      kernel)
	  
	* this is why read and write don't take an offset argument
   
 * Is the following the same as above?
	```
     $ echo one > out
     $ echo two > out
    ```

 * How to implement sequencing/lists (;,&&,||)
   ```
   $ gcc x.c ; ./a.out
   ```
   ```
   $ gcc x.c && ./a.out
   ```

 * How to implement nesting?
   ```
   $ (echo one; echo two) > out
   ```

*  How does the shell implement "&"?
  ``` $ sleep 2 & ```
  * Q: What if a background process exits while sh waits for a foreground process?

System call observations
==

* The fork/exec split looks wasteful; why is it useful? (A: exercise 2)

* System call interface simple, just ints and char buffers.  why not have open()
  return a pointer reference to a kernel file object?

* Linux has a nice representation of a process and its FDs, under /proc/PID/
  * maps: VA range, perms (p=private, s=shared), offset, dev, inode, pathname
  * fd: symlinks to files pointed to by each fd.

* The file descriptor design:
  * nice interaction with fork
  * FDs help make programs more general purpose: don't need special cases for
    files vs console vs pipe
  * shell pipelines only work for programs w/ common formats (lines of text)

OS organization
==

* Now we have a feel for what Unix system call interface provides, how to implement the interface?

* Why have an o/s at all?  why not just a library?
  then apps are free to use it, or not -- flexible
  apps can directly interact with hardware
  some tiny O/Ss for embedded processors work this way

* Key requirement:
  isolation
  multiplexing
  interaction

* helpful approach: abstract machine resources rather than raw hardware
  File system, not raw disk
  TCP, not a raw ethernet
  Processes, not raw CPU/memory
  abstractions often ease multiplexing and interaction
  also more convenient and portable

* Goals:
  apps must use OS interface, cannot directly interact with hardware
  apps cannot harm operating system

* Hardware support for isolation
  * Processors support user mode and kernel mode
	- some instructions can only be executed in kernel mode
		e.g., instructions to directly interact with hardware
  * If an application executes a privileged instruction hardware doesn't allow it
    - instead switches to kernel mode
	- kernel can clean up

* Leverage hardware support

  * Operating systems runs in kernel mode
	- kernel is a big program
	  services: processes, file system, net
	  low-level: devices, virtual memory
	  all of kernel runs with full hardware privilege (convenient)
	  
  * Applications run in user mode
	- isolated from kernel
	- systems calls switch between user and kernel mode
	  application call instructions to enter kernel
	  instruction enters kernel at an entry point specified by kernel

* What to run in kernel mode?

	* xv6 follows a traditional design: all of the OS runs in kernel mode
	  - this design is called a monolithic kernel
	  - kernel interface ~= system call interface
	  - good: easy for subsystems to cooperate
		one cache shared by file system and virtual memory
	  - bad: interactions are complex
		leads to bugs
		no isolation within kernel

	* alternative: microkernel design
	  - many OS services run as ordinary user programs
		file system in a file server
	  - kernel implements minimal mechanism to run services in user space
		IPC
		virtual memory
		threads
	  - kernel interface != system call interface		
	  - good: more isolation

	* jos: doesn't abstract hardware resources, but still provide isolation

* Can one have process isolation WITHOUT h/w-supported kernel/user mode?
  yes!
  see Singularity O/S, later in semester
  but h/w user/kernel mode is the most popular plan

xv6 kernel address space
==

* boundary between apps and kernel
   kernel/user bit
   kernel address space
   ...
   
* start w. kernel address space
  machine has booted
  code runs without virtual memory
  set up up kernel address space
  walk through kvmalloc()
